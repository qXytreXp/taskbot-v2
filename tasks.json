However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile.

That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between \"Just Visiting\" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to \"get out of jail\", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.\nBy starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.\nStatistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00.

Then,\nIf the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.\nIf the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\n\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\nNegative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968.\nPositive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\n\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 \u00d7 5 = 1.480396016.\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 \u00d7 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\n\n\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples).

The first puzzle in the file is the above example which is coded as follows:\n6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X\nThe first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed to insert information.\nThe content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left to right and starting with the top line.\nX = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.\nO (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.\nA = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.\n( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case \"h\" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case \"v\". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the \"tens\" and the second one for the \"units\". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.\nThe description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.\nThe required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must be assigned the remaining digit.\nYou are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in the file is 64414157580.\nFind the sum of the answers for the 200 puzzles.\n"}, {"id": 425, "url": "https://projecteuler.net/problem=425", "title": "Prime connection", "text": "\n\nTwo positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by \"A \u2194 B\") if one of these conditions holds:\n(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 \u2194 173.\n(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 \u2194 223 and 123 \u2194 23.\n\n\nWe call a prime P a 2's relative if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.\n\n\nFor example, 127 is a 2's relative.

Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\nQuick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, alpha = 30 degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m3.

It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.\nFred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.\nIf Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of x for all possible square space wastage options and calculate sum x correct to 9 decimal places.\n"}, {"id": 432, "url": "https://projecteuler.net/problem=432", "title": "Totient sum", "text": "\n\nLet S(n,m) = \u2211\u03c6(n \u00d7 i) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m.

Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.\nLet F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors.

After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.\nShe claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n\n\n\nMany millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.\nKatharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.\n\n\n(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits\n\n\n(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining\n\nThe records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.\nKatharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].\nIn order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.\n(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)\n"}, {"id": 576, "url": "https://projecteuler.net/problem=576", "title": "Irrational jumps", "text": "\n\nA bouncing point moves counterclockwise along a circle with circumference 1 with  jumps of constant length l<1, until it hits a gap of length g<1, that is placed in a distance d counterclockwise from the starting point.

Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:\n\nAny variable x (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.\nIf M and N are lambda-terms, then (M N) is a lambda-term, called the application of M to N.\nIf x is a variable and M is a term, then (lambda x. M) is a lambda-term, called an abstraction. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking x as parameter and sending back M.\n\nA lambda-term T is said to be closed if for all variables x, all occurrences of x within T are contained within some abstraction (lambda x. M) in T. The smallest such abstraction is said to bind the occurrence of the variable x. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term (lambda x. x) is closed, while the term (lambda x. (x y)) is not because y is not bound.\nAlso, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that (lambda x. x) and (lambda y. y) should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called alpha-equivalent. Note that (lambda x. (lambda y. (x y))) and (lambda x. (lambda x. (x x))) are not alpha-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one.
